<h1>How to Compost in New York City</h1>

    <p> Food scraps make up about a third of the waste that New Yorkers throw out every day, according to the Department of Sanitation. Curbside organics collection was part of the plan to help meet the city’s goal of sending zero waste to landfills by 2030. But the brown collection bins disappeared from the curbs during the pandemic in 2020 when the city cancelled the program. This month, plans are in motion to bring back the program.</p>

<p>So far, organics collection has returned to only a sliver of New York: the areas served by Brooklyn Community Board 6. Before the pandemic, the city offered curbside organics pickup in 44 community boards. One reason for this is that buildings had to re-enroll in the program, and the Department of Sanitation used re-enrollment numbers to measure “demand.”</p>

<p>The opt-in nature of the program has drawn criticism. “It was voluntary before. And of course, that's part of the problem,” Eric Goldstein, environment director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, told <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/new-york-city-is-reviving-curbside-composting-critics-say-its-a-step-back">Gothamist</a>. “What we really need is universal curbside collection and a vibrant community drop-off program for food scraps and yard waste.”</p>

<p>Composting serves an important role in meeting the city’s climate goals. Organic materials that get trapped in landfills release methane into the atmosphere. When such materials are composted, they don't release greenhouse gases. Instead, they become healthy soils that are returned to the community and distributed to local parks and gardens.</p>

<p>Even though there is limited access to curbside organics collection right now, there are still ways to compost in New York City.</p>

<p> Storing food scraps in airtight containers in the fridge or freezer reduces odors and makes it easier to transport scraps to collection sites, which are located around the city, such as:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><a href="https://www.grownyc.org/compost">Grow NYC’s food scrap drop-off sites</a>, located at greenmarkets and other locations</li></p>

<p><li><a href="https://www.bigreuse.org/service/what-to-compost/">Big Reuse’s food scrap drop-off sites</a>, which are run by community partners</li></p>

<p><li>Community gardens, urban farms, and other neighborhood initiatives may also collect food scraps in your area</li></p>

<p><li><a href="https://www.bkrot.org/">BK ROT</a> is a bike-powered food waste and compost hauling service, with sliding-scale rates. </li></p>

  <p>If you have outdoor space, such as a backyard, terrace, roof garden, or alleyway, it’s possible to install a composting bin. NYC Composting Project has a handy <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yFGju0-4ohTWMw6SUCOqIVGyBP9Li9oz/view"> guide to outdoor composting</a>, in spaces of all sizes.</p>


  <p>For indoor spaces, worm bins are an option. These bins fit easily under a sink. NYC Compost Project has thorough instructions for <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hq0HjErxXSHj0QIypHUQT6nSMWtBIP0C/view">link how to set up and care for a worm bin</a>.</p>

<p>The city’s organic collection will pick up all food waste and yard waste, including meat and fish scraps, bones, oily foods, shells from seafood, cheese, dairy products. However, most of the food scrap drop-off sites listed above do not have capacity to process these foods.</p>

<p>Food scrap drop-off sites most commonly accept these items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fruit and vegetable scraps</li>
<li>Leaves and grass clippings</li>
<li>Coffee grounds and filters</li>
<li>Bread and grains</li>
<li>Eggshells and nutshells</li>
<li>Food-soiled paper towels and paper napkins</li>
<li>Shredded newspaper</li>
<li>Sawdust and wood shavings from untreated wood</li>
<li>Stale beans, flour, and spices</li>
<li>Cut or dried flowers</li>
<li>Houseplants and potting soil</li>
</ul>

<p>Inorganic materials like fruit stickers, plastic bags, and plastic cutlery simply don’t biodegrade and, therefore, are not compostable. Cat litter, dog poop, diapers, and hygienic products should not be tossed in compost collection bins of any kind, either.</p>
